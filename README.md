# RUMOR-RIDING-ANONYMIZING-UNSTRUCTURED-PEER-TO-PEER-SYSTEMS

Although anonymizing Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems often incurs extra costs in 
terms of transfer efficiency, many systems try to mask the identities of their users for 
privacy considerations. Existing anonymity approaches are mainly path-based: peers 
have to pre-construct an anonymous path before transmission. The overhead of 
maintaining and updating such paths is significantly high, a lightweight mutual 
anonymity protocol for decentralized P2P systems. Peer system employs a random walk 
scheme which frees initiating peers from the heavy load of path construction. Compared 
with previous RSA-based anonymity approaches, RR also takes advantage of lower 
cryptographic overhead by mainly utilizing a symmetric cryptographic algorithm to 
achieve anonymity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this design through tracedriven simulations. The analytical and experimental results show that peer system is 
more efficient than existing protocols.
